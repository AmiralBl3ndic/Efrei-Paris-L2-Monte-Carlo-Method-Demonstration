# Monte Carlo Method demonstration
###### A software by Camille BRIAND & Jérémi FRIGGIT for the "Energy, Entropy and Information" course

This software allows you to draw something and to perform area analysis on the drawing.

It will provide the exact area of the drawing and you will be able to select a precision level to compute the area using the Monte Carlo method.

The goal of this software is to be as graphical and easy to use as possible.
